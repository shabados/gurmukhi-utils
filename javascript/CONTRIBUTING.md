## Testing

_Role: contributors wishing to change the project source code_

- Local tests are located in the javascript folder.
- The in-house global test runner `guut` is located at `javascript/test/globals.js`. These are intended to run against the root gurmukhi-utils `test` folder.
- The `guut` global test runner is based off [`uvu/assert`](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu).
- Run tests by setting the javascript folder as your current working directory in the terminal and then executing `npm run test`.
