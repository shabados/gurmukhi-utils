# Gurmukhi Utils

Utility libraries for converting, analyzing, and testing Gurmukhi strings.

## WIP

These libraries are a work in progress! Note that the API can change unexpectedly when upgrading. Libraries won't use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) properly until version 1.0.0 (or in the case of the JavaScript library until version 4.0.0). Please do not use for critical projects yet.

**Progress**
